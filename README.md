# SonicMorph

### 🎵 A Real-Time 3D Sound Visualizer
SonicMorph is an interactive OpenGL-based sound visualizer built with Pygame. It generates dynamic 3D shapes that morph in response to real-time audio frequency and amplitude.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎶 **Audio-Driven Visuals** – Shapes react to sound frequency and amplitude.
- 🔄 **Morphing Geometries** – Transitions smoothly between spheres, toruses, flowers, squares, and spirals.
- 🎛 **Real-Time Controls** – Adjust frequency, amplitude, morphing, and twist effects with keyboard inputs.
- 🎨 **Customizable Colors & Effects** – Modify base colors and enable wireframe mode.
- 🎥 **Interactive Camera** – Rotate, zoom, and pan the visualization.

## 🖥️ Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed:
```sh
pip install pygame PyOpenGL numpy
```

## ▶️ Running the Visualizer
Simply execute the Python script:
```sh
python sound.py
```

## 🎮 Controls
| Key | Action |
|------|---------|
| `↑ / ↓` | Increase / Decrease frequency |
| `PgUp / PgDn` | Increase / Decrease amplitude |
| `M / N` | Manual morph control |
| `T / Y` | Increase / Decrease twist effect |
| `WASD` | Move camera |
| `← / →` | Rotate camera |
| `L` | Toggle wireframe mode |
| `Space` | Toggle sound |
| `H` | Toggle info overlay |
| `Esc` | Quit the program |
